              Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
              ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
              keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
              everything out.

            <p class="article-body">
              A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
              don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the
              impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye
              where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
