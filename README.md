# Simple responsive website

## The Motivation

After building a simple responsive navigation bar, it is time to step-up in building the landing page of site.

First, look at the mock up design and visualize "how do we structure and group them", "is there any similaritites in the contents".

Start with structuring the Markup of your HTML, CSS will be the later part that's where all the fun begins. :)
